## Bio 
I am a Research Scientist in the [Statistical Genomics and Systems Genetics](https://www.embl.org/groups/stegle/) group  at European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), where I currently focus on evaluating trustworthy machine learning methods for healthcare applications, as a part of [European Lighthouse on Safe and Secure AI](https://elsa-ai.eu). My research interests span computational biology, cheminformatics, and natural language processing (NLP). 

Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), where I worked with machine learning models to represent cancer and population cohorts by integrating variant impact scoring. Additionally, I worked on sequence-based modeling of the *Drosophila* genome to identify TAD boundary grammar. My PhD research at Bogazici University focused on NLP-based representation learning for drug-target interaction modeling, earning the [Best PhD Dissertation Award](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/news/hakime-öztürk-receives-bap-dissertation-award) in 2020.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about mentoring and advancing diversity in science. I have had the privilege of mentoring participants at [DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org/istanbul/) events and [MoveMINT](https://www.hs-mannheim.de/gleichstellung/movemint.html), supporting women in STEM.
